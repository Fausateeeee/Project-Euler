Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square spiral with side length 7 is formed.

*37 36  35  34  33 32  *31
38  *17 16  15  14 *13 30
39  18  *5  4   *3 12  29
40  19  6   1   2  11  28
41  20  *7  8   9  10  27
42  21  22  23  24 25  26
*43 44  45  46  47 48  49

It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal,
 but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; 
 that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.

If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side length 9 will be formed. 
If this process is continued, what is the side length of the square spiral for which the 
ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?
