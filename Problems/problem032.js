We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, 
the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.

The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.
HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.

/*
    A thing that must stay true is that the number of each digit must add to 9, so if D(n) outputs the number of digits of n
    and nm = p is pandigital, then D(n) + D(m) + D(p) = 9

    Case D(n) = 1 => D(m) = 4
    If D(n) = 1, then D(m) must be greater than 3 since it is impossible  to get a 5 digits product
    Moreover, D(m) must be smaller than 5 since the product will have ar lest 5 number and the sum will be greater than 9
    Also, n can't be 1.

    Case D(n) = 2 => D(m) = 3
    If D(n) = 2, then D(m) must be greater than 2 or the digit sum will be smaller than 9
    Also, D(m) must be smaller than 4 or else the digit sum will be greater than 9

    If D(n) = 3 or 4, we are in the previous cases
    If greater, impossible
