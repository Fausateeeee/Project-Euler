The primes 3, 7, 109, and 673, are quite remarkable. 
By taking any two primes and concatenating them in any order the result will always be prime. 
For example, taking 7 and 109, both 7109 and 1097 are prime. 
The sum of these four primes, 792, represents the lowest sum for a set of four primes with this property.

Find the lowest sum for a set of five primes for which any two primes concatenate to produce another prime.
